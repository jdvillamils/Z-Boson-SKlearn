# Basic Analysis of a BDT in ZZ production, using SciKit Learn.

This is a simple analysis of the ZZ Diboson production in the four lepton final state, with the library sklearn, to study the behavior of a boosted decision tree.

Using [PyROOT](https://root.cern/manual/python/) and the available [Atlas Open Data](http://opendata.atlas.cern), we process a fraction of the samples form signal and background of the ZZ production, according the [criteria](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/physics/FL1.html).

## To run

Just run the different cells in the notebook ZZBoson.ipynb. You can change the samples being used, and the amout of events you want to study.
